# Singleton Design Pattern

The Singleton method or Singleton Design pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. It ensures a class only has one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

## when to use

Use the Singleton method Design Pattern when:

- There must be exactly one instance of a class and it must be accessible to clients from a well-known access point.
- When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying
- Singleton classes are used for logging, driver objects, caching, and thread pool, database connections.
