# Design Patterns

DP are typical solutions to common problems in software design.

## classification

### creational pattern

provides object creation mechanism that increases flexibility and reuse of existing code.

- Factory method

It is also know as virtual constructor. It provides an interface for creating objects in superclass, but allows subclass to alter type of object

-- use it when you dont know before hand the type and dependencies of the objects your code should work with
-- use it when you want to provide users a way to extend internal components of code

### structural patterns

explains how to assemble objects and classes into layer structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient

### Behavioral Patern

take care of effectiev communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects
